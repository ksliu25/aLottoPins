###About
aLottoPins is my first AngularJS project as part of the NextCapital coding challenge. Starting from the angularseed boilerplate it was an extremely educational experience that taught me:

- Consuming backend REST API
- User Auth (Might use local storage for persistence but for now cookies dependencies will do...)
- MVWhatever architecture
- Skinny Model, Fat Controller (as opposed to Rails' Skinny Controller fat Model)
- Modals and resolves
- UI Routing and nested templating routes before choosing Modals
- Best practices by John Papa, Angular Evangelist
